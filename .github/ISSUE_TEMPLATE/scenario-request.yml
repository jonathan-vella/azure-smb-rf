        ## 📋 Deployment Feedback / Variant Request

        Use this template to suggest improvements, cost optimisations, or new variant
        options for the SMB Landing Zone deployment scenarios (baseline, firewall, vpn, full).

    attributes:
      label: Target Scenario
      description: Which deployment scenario does this relate to?
      options:
        - baseline
        - firewall
        - vpn
        - full

      label: Proposal Description
      description: What change or addition are you proposing and why?
      placeholder: |
        The baseline scenario currently deploys Azure Bastion Developer tier.
        I'd like an option to omit Bastion entirely for cost-sensitive customers
        who will use VPN for access instead.
