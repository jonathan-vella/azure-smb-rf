# Governance Constraints - {project-name}

> Generated by bicep-plan agent | {date} | Artifact v{artifact-version}

This document captures the governance constraints and Azure Policy requirements
that must be addressed in the Bicep implementation.

## Azure Policy Compliance

**Governance Source**: Project-defined (default)

<!-- Default: Greenfield - policies deployed by this project -->

These policies will be assigned at subscription scope as part of the Bicep deployment.
Policy cleanup script: `scripts/Remove-{project-name}Policies.ps1`

<!-- Override: Brownfield - use only when user explicitly requests subscription scan -->
<!-- These policies were discovered in the target subscription and must be respected. -->
